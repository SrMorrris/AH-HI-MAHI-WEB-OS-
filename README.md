# AH-HI-MAHI-WEB-OS-
A very good compilation about my created bootstrap web pages.
Ah-hi-mahi-web/OS contains every single one web page i have build on bootstrap.
This it`s the Jekyll style on bootstrap 4.0 (heheh it`s so easy to achieve..)
Instructions for your web-page
1--Select the branch correspondient to the different web-page
2--The Main-branch contains the main and principal web-page (the central-one which you can go every web-page)
3--Other branchs contain one web-page for every single one device i have built. 1 branch - 1 device - 1 web-page
4--Download the file, unzip it and "git bash" (see tutorials for github and bootstrap)
5--customize your web-page, changing images, etc..
6--edit the index.html for resize your images,change the text, etc..
Enjoy your web-page!!
